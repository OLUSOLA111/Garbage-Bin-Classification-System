# Garbage-Bin-Classification-System
For this assignment/project, we developed/implemented a garbage classification model using transfer learning with the aid of VGG-16 (a model pre-trained on imagenet).
The garbage was classified into three bin classes Blue, Green and Black. The Blue bin is for recyclable items, the black bin is for items that cannot be recycled otherwise known as 'garbage, and the green bin is for compost itmes.
